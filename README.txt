## How It's Made:
 
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongodb, Express
 
Our lives are what we make it. What alot of people don't know is that checking in with yourself as you would with friends or family is the isolated attention our mental needs and deserves. In order to show up for yourself you can practice your mental hygiene ('just as you would go to the gym to work on your physical').Check in here, with your own personal "burn book" acting as a safe journal implementing the freedom of expression.Do not waste any time being absent in your own space; and rather take matters into your own hands and be the bestest friend you maybe never had.

Mongodb used to store user's information such as log-in's (using passport.js) and entries ( using ejs templates) being recored into te database for recollection. The client-side javaScript allows users to delete, entries as they please. And also fetches an API that is used to display 'daily affirmations' to the user once logged in.
